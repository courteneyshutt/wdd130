            Here at Beagle Bookkeeping, we do a lot of different things to include keeping track of expenses for a business, keeping track of clients for a business, or keeping track of sales and inventory.  We are certified in QuickBooks and are very familiar how to keep a business running through this program.  This website has many different resources to help you understand the different sides to the tax accounting business.  It also contains information that can be helpful for clients such as getting documents from the IRS, seeing how being self-employed can be to their benefit, and also having someone guide them through contacting the IRS and negotiating what they owe.  We also are able to give package pricing for those who many be interested with our services and may need help in more than one area.  We also have our contact information in which you can contact us a number of ways to include phone, email, and social media.
