      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>How do you feel when you know that tax time has come around again?  Are you overcome by worry and anxiety?  Well, I am here to change your outlook on taxes!  My team and I have a combined total of over 50 years of experience.  We are here to provide you with assistance with either personal taxes, letters from the IRS, helping you not owe every year, or just plain bookkeeping for your company.  Most people who have come to us have always done taxes on their own or end up getting letters from the IRS.  We have helped them become more confident while also fighting for them.  We also make everything affordable to easy bundle deals to flat rates for every scenario.  When it comes to taxes, we have your back while making sure to keep money in your pocket!</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This site is mainly geared towards anyone who owns a business or works and is required to file taxes.  This group of people will range anywhere from  young adult all the way up to the elderly.  This will also attract different types of people in different income ranges, different lifestyles, and different backgrounds.  I plan on using this for adults who are just beginning to file taxes or run their own business.  This is also for adults who have become expert business people but are getting overwhelmed by the amount of bookkeeping it takes as their business grows.  We will be able to help anyone with anything of any level!  </p>  <!-- change this -->

        Here at Beagle Bookkeeping, we do a lot of different things to include keeping track of expenses for a business, keeping track of clients for a business, or keeping track of sales and inventory.  We are certified in QuickBooks and are very familiar how to keep a business running through this program.  This website has many different resources to help you understand the different sides to the tax accounting business.  It also contains information that can be helpful for clients such as getting documents from the IRS, seeing how being self-employed can be to their benefit, and also having someone guide them through contacting the IRS and negotiating what they owe.  We also are able to give package pricing for those who many be interested with our services and may need help in more than one area.  We also have our contact information in which you can contact us a number of ways to include phone, email, and social media.

      <h3>IRS Information]</h3>
      <p>
        The main site that is useful for taxes and keeping track of accounts for personal or business reasons is IRS.gov.  This website will soon become everyone’s friend.  Anyone is able to set up their own account and look up past returns, balances owed, and even transcripts of anything someone can think of.  If someone owns their own business, they can set up one account for their business and one for their personal returns.  This method will be better in the long run so everything is kept organized.  Also, the transcripts that were mentioned are useful for getting income information, past tax returns that were filed, along with any payment arrangements that have been made to the IRS.  This website is also used for making payments to the IRS whether it is money owed to them or estimated quarterly payments.  The quarterly payments you can make under whichever account that you need.  Typically, people who run their own business will want to make these payments quarterly to avoid owing the government anything at the end of the year.  We will also help clients call the IRS through different ways of representation.  We can make it so we call them for you without your presence or you sitting with us.  We can also help write letters to the IRS depending on the letter they send to appeal or disagree with something they came up with and we can fight for your money.

      <h3>[Package Information]</h3>
      <p>
        Filing personal and business taxes can become very expensive at times.  If someone needs to file both, then they are paying double each year.  We are very sensitive to people’s situations and offer package prices to help anyone.  Theses package prices include ones for families, self-employed people, retired people, and people who are trying to make some money from their investments.  We also have prices for the simplest of clients along with anyone with teenagers who have part-time summer job.  We also will help those that have trusted us to handle their books for their business when it comes to filing both the business and personal taxes.  We can also do package prices that include helping someone contact the IRS who may have had trouble in the past, need help getting a refund, and filing all in one year.  Lastly, we always like to reward people who are satisfied with our work and bring their friends to us.  We have different incentives such as paying the person, discounting their package, or maybe even getting something for free!
